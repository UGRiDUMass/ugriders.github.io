UGRiD stands for "Undergraduate Researchers Interested in Data". It's a group that consists of Five College students from cross-interdisciplinary backgrounds who have an interest in Data Science. This semester, we'll be preparing for an annual data competition called Datafest. We primarily work with R Programming and don't worry if you're new to the language. We will provide you with information and a set of tools to help you get started. We will also be hosting workshops and guest lecturers here on campus. We have Saturday Meetings at the W.E.B DuBois Library Room 1667 (16th Floor).

For any new members, I would suggest you get started by going over to our resource page! 

Also don't forget to contact us, we need your email so we can add you onto our group!
