In preparation of this weekend's Five College DataFest, we've put together some resources to help participants prepare. 

Firstly, the slides from our [Intro to R Workshop](http://rpubs.com/ermoore/introR) presented on March 22nd.

For additional resouces used to help our members prepare for DataFest in the past, view [a previous post](http://ugrid.info/2018/02/25/datafest_summary.html) on our site. 

Best of luck to everyone participating, we hope you all have a great time and learn a lot!
