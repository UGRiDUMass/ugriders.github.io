To help everyone prepare for DataFest, we've put together some resources for today's meeting that will hopefully give you a good sense of why DataFest is worth participating in, and how to actually approach analyzing such a large dataset once it does happen. For today's meeting, we will be working with a housing prices dataset from Kaggle, which you can download [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques).
