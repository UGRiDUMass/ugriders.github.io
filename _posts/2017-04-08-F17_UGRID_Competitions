Hey guys, in this meeting we will start our data analysis on datasets pertaining to previous or ongoing competitions. After Datafest, I thought this would be a good practice to have the club see more real world data. Data Competition are a great for beginners to benchmark themselves and learn from others, but it is also a great source of reputation if you are able to win. Data Competitions can award their participants with prizes ranging anywhere from $50 - $1,000,000.  
- *Wrap up the Movie Dataset*: You can continue working on the movie dataset, but if you want to showcase your work please email us back with your rmd file.
- *Schedule tentative plans*: We're Recruiting Officers! Please talk to one of the current officers or email us if you have any interest in helping out!
- *Talk about Datafest*: Today we're going to talk about PROS and CONS about Datafest. First, I would like to say thank you for those of you who could stick around for the entirety of Datafest. There is great honor for the club and the representing school for participating in this event. For many our members, I can imagine how busy and stressful the weekend was. Working on a extremely large dataset can also be difficult. There are multiple ways to circumventing this issue, but I would suggest having a good grasp on data manipulation would take you further as a Data Scientist. Overall, we will discuss more about our experience in today's club meeting.
