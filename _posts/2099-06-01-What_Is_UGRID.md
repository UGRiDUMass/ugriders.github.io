UGRiD stands for "Undergraduate Researchers Interested in Data". It's a group that consists of Five College students from cross-interdisciplinary backgrounds who have an interest in Data Science. We host collaborative data analysis sessions that include educational presentations on topics like machine learning, data visualization tools, and telling stories with your data. We hope to have meetings split evenly between education and collaboration, and want to foster an environment where members can be free to work and present on whatever data-related topics they find most interesting. We will also be hosting workshops and guest lecturers here on campus. We have Sunday Meetings from 3-5PM at the W.E.B DuBois Library (Room 1667)

For any new members, we suggest you get started by going over to our resource page. Don't hesitate to contact us with any questions or concerns you may have!
