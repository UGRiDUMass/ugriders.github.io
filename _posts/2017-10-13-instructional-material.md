title: Instructional Material from UGRiD Officers
---

In this post, we present documents from UGRiD officers Ryan, Jagath, and Evan that are meant to be an entry into performing data analysis in both Python and R. Check out Jagath's R script using Titanic data [here](https://github.com/jagath-jaikumar/TitanicExploration/blob/master/titanic_exploration.R) and Ryan's exploration of videogame sales in Python [here](https://www.kaggle.com/coffeepot/videogame-sales). we will be posting more material aimed at beginners in the coming  weeks, so stay tuned for that!
