title: Interview Tips
---


Hello fellow UGRID members,

I was hoping to give you guys some small advice if you're still applying for jobs, but I've kind of gone overboard with my writing. I know it's final exam season, but I would urge you to keep at it because job postings tend to decrease over the summer. Btw, if you guys have any advice or feedback feel free to reply down below.

**[The Right Keywords] : What do you type when you search for a job? What do you normally write in your resume? What do you usually say to a recruiter?**

First of all, I normally type in the keywords "data" or "analyst" in the search box because I get the broad range of results that I am looking for. When you type something like "data scientist" you're getting a specialized field where they typically ask for PHDs or 5 years of experience. Sometimes I would go as far as typing the software or programming language that I specialize in.

When you end up finding a job that suits you, they will give you an exact description of what kind of skills or person that they're looking for. Make sure you either paraphrase or put down those exact skills inside your resume because that's how they know who to call.  If there is a skill that you don't know, but it comes up a lot in many job descriptions. I would say put it in anyways! Just make sure to read up on that specific skill, start learning that skill, and be humble about your level of experience (e.g. I've used it once on a small project).

Now you're talking to a recruiter or a hiring manager, make sure you repeat all those keywords that you've read in the job description. Also come up with a story of where you have implemented those skills whether it’s in a professional, academic, or recreational setting (hint: I've learned about this skill in UGRiD). Another friendly advice, the key is not to just answer all the question thrown at you. Try befriending the recruiter! If they ask you whether you have any questions, make sure you have a list prepared. If you don’t, try asking the recruiter about themselves. (e.g. what benefits has this company brought to you? Why or how did you become a manager?). They’ve spent all this time fixed on you, make them feel good by opening the conversation to them. Even if they forget everything about the interview, by the time it’s over they would at least remember that you were the person that ended it on a good note.

**[Stand out] : When applying for jobs one of the most important things you can do is stand out from the rest of the crowd. You can do that by several ways:**

*Create a Website:* Which you can learn to do that by going to www.UGRID.info > Resources > Workshop Slides > Workshop 4: Building a Data Science Portfolio.

Normally, you can’t showcase or prove everything that you’ve put on your resume. Recruiter spend LESS THAN 1 minute on your resume so what you can do is highlight the keywords and your website. If they have any interest, they would spend the time to look at what you’ve accomplished and you stand out just by having a website portfolio. 

The other way to stand out is to become a beautiful lady or a handsome gentleman. Yes, it’s about appearances, but not the kind of appearance that you’re born genetically with (don’t worry I’m not calling you ugly or anything…). I am talking business etiquette, I’m assuming most of you haven’t learn what simple business etiquette is. There are small things, but they tend to leave you with a good first impression.

- When you meet someone in the company for the first time, standup and give them a hand shake. Make sure your handshake is “firm” not too weak and not too strong. If you have dangerously rough hands, put some moisturizer. If you have wet sweaty hands, briefly dry them by wiping it on the side of your pants.

- Now introduce yourself by saying your name with a smile.

- Make sure to look at the person’s face when talking to them. Don’t look at your phone, to the side, or anywhere else. They also say don’t stare at their eyes like you’re having a staring contest (look at the middle between the eyes or at the middle of their forehead).

- Leave a friendly and charming personality, smile at their jokes and find relatable topics (but don’t forget this person might also be your boss, so don’t overdo it).

- Always remember their name because it’s going to come up and remember to say please and thank you at the right times.

 You can google the rest yourself, if you had no idea about business etiquette before reading this.

**[Build Connections] : Honestly, more than 50% of people who do get an interview for hire come from having connections and referral from someone else.**

I mean that’s why companies ask whether you know someone working there. If you have friends or family use those connections to your advantage. If you don’t have friends or family connected to the field where you’re trying to get a job at then make new connections!

On that note: that is why we have a Linkedin group for UGRiD. Ask other members for advice, alumnus should recruit UGRiD members if given the chance, and if we all help one another I’m pretty sure we’ll be rewarded in the future.
