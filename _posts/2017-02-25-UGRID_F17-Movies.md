If you need help getting started try answering these questions for your data analysis:

- How could you determine popularity for a movie?
- Which movie or actor would you recommend to a friend?
- If you just wanted to make money... what is your targeted audience or genre?
- Perform a sentiment or text analysis on the information given: Can you identify the difference between happiness(satisfcation) and excitement(hype)? Can you rank emotions and ratings? 
- Taken from kaggle, but will the number of human faces in movie poster correlate with the movie rating?
