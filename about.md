<h3>We welcome you to meet our team of Data Scientists and Young Unicorns. UGRiD stands for "Undergraduate Researchers interested in Data". We're a low-key group that consists of Five College students. You may find other motivated students to work on interesting projects together or open a dialogue about what you've been working on/ thinking about if you want to. Since there is a rapidly growing interest in data science in the area, the goal of the group is to provide a social base for like-minded Five College students. Basically, it's like DataFest with more dialogue with more than one group.</h3>
